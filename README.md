4. Collaborate with others: Good developers understand the value of collaboration and seek out opportunities to work with others. By sharing ideas and knowledge, developers can learn from each other and produce better work.

# today's lecture.

In the lecture's beginning, we discussed the two different ways to interact with a computer system.
- **GUI** (Graphical User Interface) 
- **CLI** (Command Line Interface), 


GUI is easy to use and user friendly 

CLI is hard to master but can do multi-tasking that's why developers use it.
also, we discussed so basic CLI commands such as :
- pwd : print working directory 
- mkdir : make directory 
- cd  : change directory 
- ls : list 
 
 for more commands [check this website](https://www.plesk.com/blog/various/git-commands-cheat-sheet/) 

#### git and github 

#### VCS : is version control system 

git is a local VCS and it's vary useful because it will able the programmer to :
- backup and recovery 
- collaboration team members 
- tracking changes
- branching and merging

#### ACP cycle 
this is the method to link git and github repo 
1. git clone SSH link
2. Make your updates
3. git add .
4. git commit -m"type a description"
5. git push origin main
